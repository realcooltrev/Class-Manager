# Class-Manager
This was the final project for my C++ programming class at Ivy Tech Community College. 

This was made before I had more experience and expertise and some of the practices might not be the best and were more just to see what I could
do with my current knowledge at the time.

## c++commandline
I have branched the old C++ branch as [c++commandline](https://github.com/realcooltrev/Class-Manager/tree/c%2B%2B-commandline) and might update it with better coding standards and use of more advanced/modern features
at a later time. 

## go-commandline
Currently, I have been learning Go on the side, because, why not? I am using this as an excuse to recreate the original project in a modern
language with better standards and better encapsualtion/package management. This is under the [go-commandline branch](https://github.com/realcooltrev/Class-Manager/tree/go-commandline).

In the future, I plan on connecting the program to a database and also setting this up as a web application, since no student would ever view
their classes on the command line (well, I assume).

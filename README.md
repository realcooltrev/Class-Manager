# Class Manager
This was the final project for my C++ programming class at Ivy Tech Community College. 

This was made before I had more experience and expertise and some of the practices might not be the best and were more just to see what I could
do with my current knowledge at the time.

This version is just the C++ version, which is the original version of this application. I've cleaned up the code a little bit since its initial 
state, but I have no plans on further improving the code since I just would prefer to write code in other programming languages.

# Class Manager
This was the final project for my C++ programming class at Ivy Tech Community College. 

This was made before I had more experience and expertise and some of the practices might not be the best and were more just to see what I could
do with my current knowledge at the time.

## C++
I have branched the old C++ branch as [c++commandline](https://github.com/realcooltrev/Class-Manager/tree/c%2B%2B-commandline) and might update it with better coding standards and use of more advanced/modern features
at a later time. 

## Spring Boot
Currently, I have been learning Java and Spring Boot on the side, and I am starting to recreate the C++ command line version of the application as an MVC web application on the [spring_boot_app](https://github.com/realcooltrev/class_manager/tree/spring_boot_app).

# Class Manager
This was the final project for my C++ programming class at Ivy Tech Community College. 

## cpp_cli
I have branched the old C++ branch as [cpp_cli](https://github.com/realcooltrev/Class-Manager/tree/cpp_cli).  

This version is just the C++ version, which is the original version of this application. I've cleaned up the  
code a little bit since its initial state, but I have no plans on further improving the code since I just would   
prefer to write code in other programming languages.

## py_cli
I prefer writing code in Python, so I started work on a new version of this app that is written all in Python,  
which can be found (as of now, on the [py_cli](https://github.com/realcooltrev/Class-Manager/tree/py_cli) branch).
This version is more of an exercise in my strengthening  
my Python skills and an attempt to create a more robust application.
